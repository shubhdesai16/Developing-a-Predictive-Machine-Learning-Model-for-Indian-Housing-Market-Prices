## Developing a Predictive Machine Learning Model for Indian Housing Market Prices

Implemented a data-driven model to accurately forecast house prices in India, leveraging machine learning to guide real estate investments

**Overview**
This project focuses on predicting house prices in India using machine learning techniques. The dataset, consisting of 14,620 entries, includes detailed attributes of residential properties such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, living area, lot area, and more. The goal of the project is to create a robust predictive model that can assist stakeholders in making data-driven decisions regarding property investments.

**Project Objectives**
**Business Goal:** Build a predictive model to help stakeholders make informed decisions about property investments.
**Model Objective:** Develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts house prices based on key features of the properties.

**Results**
The Random Forest Regressor provided the most accurate predictions, with strong performance metrics indicating its reliability for real-world applications. 

**Implementation**

Real Estate Agencies: For providing accurate property price estimates.
Financial Institutions: For assessing property values during loan approvals.
Urban Planners: For making data-driven decisions in urban development.

**Conclusion**
The project successfully demonstrates the use of machine learning to predict house prices in India. The model's high accuracy and real-time prediction capabilities make it a powerful tool for various stakeholders in the real estate industry.
